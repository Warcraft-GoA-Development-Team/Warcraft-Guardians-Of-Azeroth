GWCBDESC_1;You, [This.GetFirstName], by besting the human race, proved to the world that gnolls can be a force to reckon with when united against a common enemy. Now it is time to make the other races of Azeroth tremble before the name of [This.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTGW2;Stormwind prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GWCBDESC_2;After endless raids from the rampant gnoll tribes across the kingdom, we finally put a stop to them.

EVTDESC_WCGW_600;You have sent out summons to all of your gnoll vassals for the festival. There you will skin prisoners and slaves dead or alive, and use the skins to sew into tents, mats, and clothes. They are then butchered, cooked, and the next day served in a massive feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_600;I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_WCGW_600;Summoned to festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_601;Your powerful liege, [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to a skinning festival. There you will skin prisoners and slaves dead or alive, and use the skins to sew into tents, mats, and clothes. They are then butchered, cooked, and the next day served in a massive feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_601;Yummy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_604;The guests have arrived, and the time has come for the festival to begin! You gather outside the slave pens, and start by rounding up prisoners you think would be delicious. Any prisoner who tries to escape or avoid selection is killed on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_604;This one looks tasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_605;The time has come for the skinning festival held by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to begin! You gather outside the slave pens, and start by rounding up prisoners you think would be delicious. Any prisoner who tries to escape or avoid selection is killed on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_606;You never thought it would end like this... Your captor, [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is holding a skinning festival where [Root.Host.GetSheHe] and [Root.Host.GetHerHis] subjects will skin you, then turn you into clothes and a meal. Guards drag you away to the kitchen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_606;No! Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_610;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. [From.GetSheHe] screams and squirms as the cooks move their skinning knives up [From.GetHerHis] arm. Eventually the screams stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_610;Good riddance, [From.GetSheHe] was starting to get annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_610;No, I have changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_613;Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. As the cooks sharpen their knives, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_613;I don't want it any other way! Gag him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_613;You're right, I can't do this to my own brother...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_614;Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your cooks sharpen their knives. Please, [Root.GetFirstName]. Don't let them do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_614;Ha!! What a joke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_614;No... not my own sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_615;Your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen where they begin to sharpen their knives. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_615;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_615;I can't do this to my own father...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_616;Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from the pens. They bring her to the kitchen and as the cooks sharpen their knives, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_616;Because I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_616;I... I wouldn't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_617;The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from the pens and lead him to the kitchen. There, the cooks sharpen their knives on a flat rock. Before the cooks place the knives on his skin, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_617;Your tears amuse me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_617;I can't do this... not to my own boy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_618;Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from the pens and brought to the kitchen by your guards. As they sharpen their knives, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_618;What can I say? It's fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_618;No, send her back... not to my girl...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_619;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from the pens by the guards and placed at the chopping block in the kitchen. As they place the knife on [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_619;You're annoying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_619;It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_620;Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the chopping block in the kitchen and your cooks place the knife on [From.GetHerHis] neck. In a last desperate effort to save [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_620;Love means nothing to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_620;No, this is too much... I can't permit it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_622;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the kitchen and a knife is dragged across [FromFrom.GetHerHis] flesh. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body sits mutilated and skinless in the warm air from the cooking pot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_622;I can't wait to eat [FromFrom.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WCGW_634;As you have no prisoners languishing in your dungeons that are suitable for sacrifice at the blot, you are forced to make do with some randomly purchased slaves. They are brought to the kitchen, and soon their savory limbs are in the cooking pot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_634;Not of any particular status, but the taste is always better than the feeling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_640;With the skinning over, the feast at the end of the festival can now begin. The meat of the prisoners that were sacrificed has already been prepared, and there is plenty of melon juice to go around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_640;Let the feast begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_641;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_642;The feast is over and with it the festival. It will be at least a year until you hold the next one, but as your vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_642;It was very delicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_643;The feast is over and with it the festival. It will be at least a year until your liege holds the next one, but as you and the other vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_650;The mead and the spirits being served at the feast have gotten the better of you. You tried to be strong this time, and you did your best to stay away, but the pull was just too great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_650;*hic* Doesch gnoll tashte bedder tan humie...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_651;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been drinking more and more since the feast began, and suddenly [From.GetSheHe] lunged towards one of the atendees and bit their arm off! Surrounded by empty tankards and [From.GetHerHis] blood stained teeth, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying on the table amidst the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_651;Entertaining, but that was a friend of mine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_651;*hic* Letsch hav bite too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_653;Your mouth waters as servants place tray after tray of food on the table, and when the other guests engage in conversation, the only sounds coming from your corner are grunts and burps as you begin stuffing yourself. A sudden nausea sets in and you hurry towards the exit, but only make it as far as the lap of [From.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_653;UUAARGGHHHH...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_654;Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as your seat before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into your lap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_654;I'll kill you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_WCGW_655;Uh oh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_656;As you enjoy the feast, you are struck by the warmth and kindness of those sitting next to you at the table. In fact, it's getting just a little too warm. You strip off your clothes and jump up on the table. Help, I'm on fire! you scream at the top of your lungs while waving your arms as the other bewildered guests look on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_656;Put me out, put me out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_657;You are enjoying the feast when a shrill scream from the other end of the room suddenly draws your attention. Stark naked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is running around on the table waving [From.GetHerHis] arms while screaming that [From.GetSheHe] is on fire. You laugh hysterically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_657;What a fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_657;So [From.GetSheHe] is! And... and so am I! AAAHHH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_658;One of the serving girls has been eyeing you ever since you arrived at the feast, and now, fortified with mead, your hands grope at her body and she returns the favor. You pull off each other's clothes and give in to passion. Just as you join in her screams of pleasure, it dawns on you that you're doing this in full view of all the other stunned guests...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_658;What are you looking at?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_658;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will not be happy about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_659;You are conversing with another guest when loud screams of passion interrupt. In one corner of the room, in full view of everyone else, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is engaged in carnal pleasures with one of the serving girls. Both are completely naked, and only when they notice the stunned silence in the room do they seem to remember where they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_659;Not unusual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WCGW_659;Mmmmmmmmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_WCGW_659;Doesn't [From.GetSheHe] have a mate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_661;You have been seated next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the duration of the feast, and you have found [From.GetHerHim] to be a most agreeable person. There seems to be much you have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WCGW_661;It would seem I have a new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_680;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. When [From.GetSheHe] sees the sharpened knife about to be scraped across [From.GetHerHis] flesh, [From.GetSheHe] pushes the nearest guard aside and makes a desperate run for it, but to no avail. Your men drag [From.GetHerHim] kicking and screaming back to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_WCGW_681;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. Even as the butcher cleans up the mess from previous victims, [From.GetFirstName] stares vacantly ahead without betraying any emotion whatsoever. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] has accepted [From.GetHerHis] fate, but it doesn't take long until [From.GetSheHe] screams as [From.GetHerHis] face is mutilated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WCGW_682;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from the pens and escorted to the kitchen. As soon as [From.GetSheHe] spots you among those gathered nearby, [From.GetSheHe] hurls insults and spittle your way, continuing even as the knives are placed on [From.GetHerHis] skin. The hatred in [From.GetHerHis] eyes cannot be mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
