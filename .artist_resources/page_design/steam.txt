[h1] Welcome to the World of Azeroth! [/h1]

"Guardians of Azeroth" is a mod with a worldwide development team, based on the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Entertainment. In this mod, our team is working to recreate the world of Azeroth in all of its glory, particularly focusing on the story of the classic Warcraft strategy games and World of Warcraft Classic. In this mod, you will be able to assume the role of one of the human kings, elven counts, or murloc chieftans in order test your luck in the quest for bringing Azeroth under your heel! You can restore justice to Azeroth, plunge the world into the chaos and fulfill the prophecy that is the Hour of Twilight, or burn it all in the name of Sargeras. If that is not your style, you can also choose to indebt every living realm on Azeroth to your wealthy Goblin cartel. Every decision is yours to make!

[b]FEATURES:[/b]
[list]
[*]Every nation found on the four continents of Azeroth are available for playing. You can play anyone: from the smallest murloc chief to the twin princes of Ahn'Qiraj.
[*]Ability to recreate many historical, and sometimes ancient, empires of old such as the Empire of Zul or the Black Empire.
[*]Relive historical events throughout Warcraft, such as the invasion of the fel-fueled orcs from Draenor, the Plague of Lordaeron, or the rise of the Scarlet Crusade.
[*]Societies and governments dedicated to the service of Azeroth's great enemies. Serve the Undead Scourge, Burning Legion, or even the Old Gods in pursuit of your own personal glory.
[*]Class system (based off of the MMORPG) allowing your character to interact with others in ways pertaining to your class, such as blessing provinces and driving others to insanity.
[*]Highly detailed map of Azeroth where everyone can find many, if not all, locations from the games (let us forget Vash'jir ever happened). The mod includes many regions which you still cannot find in the MMORPG such as Plunder Isle, Tel Abim, and more.
[*]Large number of new traits allowing you to make your game character truly original.
[*]The possibility to decide the fate of your favourite characters as you want.
